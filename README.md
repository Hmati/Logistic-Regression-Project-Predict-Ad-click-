## Logistic-Regression-Project-Predict-Ad-click-
# Logisitc Regression is commonly used to estimate the probability that an instance belongs to a particular class. 
# If the estimated probability that an instance is greater than 50%, then the model predicts that the instance belongs to that class 1, 
# or else it predicts that it does not. This makes it a binary classifier. In this notebook we will look at the theory behind `Logistic Regression`  and use it to indicating whether or not a particular internet user clicked on an Advertisement. 
# We will try to create a model that will predict whether or not they will click on an ad based off the features of that user.
